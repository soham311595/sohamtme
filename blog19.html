        <p>
            2023 was a year of mixed signals for the stock market. After a tumultuous 2022, characterized by the Federal Reserve’s aggressive interest rate hikes, the market in 2023 found itself grappling with inflation concerns, geopolitical uncertainties, and shifting economic expectations. Despite the challenges, the market showed notable resilience, particularly in sectors like technology and energy. However, the final quarter of 2023 showed increasing signs of divergence in market performance, as some sectors began to stagnate while others surged.
