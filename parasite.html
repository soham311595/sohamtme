        <h1>Parasite: A Sharp Critique of Class and Society</h1>
        <h2>The Unexpected, Yet Unsettling, Journey Through Wealth and Poverty</h2>
        <img style="width:900px"src="src/parasite2.jpg">

        <p>So, you’ve probably heard of *Parasite*, and if you haven’t, it’s time to watch it. This film isn’t just a story about a poor family scheming their way into a rich household—it's a sharp, almost painful critique of society, wealth, and class inequality. Directed by Bong Joon-ho, *Parasite* walks the line between dark comedy, thriller, and drama, but underneath the surface, it's a deeper commentary on the societal systems that divide us.</p>

        <h2>The Perfect Setup: The Kims and the Parks</h2>
        <p>The story revolves around two families: the Kims, who live in a cramped, semi-basement apartment, and the Parks, who live in an opulent mansion. At first, it’s easy to think the Kims are the clear underdogs—poverty-stricken, struggling to make ends meet. But as the story unfolds, you begin to realize it’s not so simple. The Kims are smart, resourceful, and cunning, and they slowly infiltrate the Parks’ lives, each family member taking on a role in the household as tutors, servants, and caretakers. It’s like watching a game of chess, but the stakes are much higher.</p>

        <p>At first, it seems like a harmless con—just a way for the Kims to get by. But Bong Joon-ho does a masterful job of showing us how the divide between rich and poor is not just about money—it’s about power, opportunity, and the sheer distance between two worlds. The Kims’ struggle to enter this world of wealth isn’t just about survival, it’s about gaining access to something they’ve been denied their whole lives.</p>

        <h2>The Brilliant Satire of Class Divide</h2>
        <p>What’s fascinating is how Bong Joon-ho uses humor and satire to point out the absurdity of this class divide. The rich family, the Parks, live in a world where money is not just a tool for survival—it’s a tool for status. They’re oblivious to the struggles of the Kims and others around them, and their naïveté is both funny and tragic. In contrast, the Kims, who are far from innocent, are shown using their wits to climb up the social ladder. But the film makes it clear that no matter how hard they try, they’re still trapped by the system.</p>

        <p>There’s a dark irony here, especially when you consider how the Kims’ manipulation of the Parks is just another form of exploitation. It’s like a mirror image of the very system they’re trying to break into. Even though they’re trying to escape poverty, the Kims’ actions reveal that they’re just playing the same game, but from the other side.</p>

        <h2>The Tension Builds: A Story of Hidden Layers</h2>
        <p>One of the most striking things about *Parasite* is its ability to slowly build tension without rushing things. Bong Joon-ho takes his time, layering the plot with twists and turns that keep you on the edge of your seat. There’s the moment when the Kims find out about the secret hidden in the basement—something so shocking and unexpected that it completely shifts the tone of the movie. This moment isn’t just a plot twist for shock value; it’s a metaphor for how, beneath the surface of wealth and success, there are always hidden truths, secrets, and inequalities that no one wants to face.</p>

        <p>The underground basement itself becomes a symbol for the hidden realities of society—the things we don’t see, the people we ignore, and the way systems of power keep the poor in their place. The basement is more than just a literal space; it represents the forgotten, the repressed, and the underclass that society tries to keep hidden out of sight, out of mind. It’s a stark reminder that there’s always more going on beneath the surface.</p>

        <h2>The Tragic Consequences of a System That Values Wealth Over Humanity</h2>
        <p>Ultimately, *Parasite* is a tragedy. The way everything unravels is inevitable—one wrong move leads to chaos, and the Kims, despite all their cleverness, end up being victims of their own ambitions. This fall from grace is a sobering reminder of how, in a world built on class divisions, the only thing certain is that the system is rigged. The Kims, despite their resourcefulness, can’t win against a system that favors the rich.</p>

        <p>It’s this tragedy that makes the movie so powerful. By the end, you realize that the rich family, despite all their luxury, aren’t any better off. They’re trapped in their own way, living in a bubble of ignorance. The Kims, too, are trapped—trapped in a cycle that doesn’t allow them to escape their social status. The film leaves us with no easy answers. There’s no redemption for anyone; there’s just a painful reminder that inequality isn’t something that can be easily fixed, and that breaking free from it requires more than just clever schemes—it requires a systemic change that no one seems willing to make.</p>

        <h2>The Ending: A Mirror of Society</h2>
        <p>The ending of *Parasite* is haunting. It’s a full-circle moment that feels both inevitable and devastating. After all the scheming, the lies, and the chaos, the Kims are left in a place that’s no better than where they started. It’s a reminder that the rich, no matter how many floors their house has, can never truly escape the inequalities of society. And the poor, no matter how hard they fight, remain shackled to a system that values wealth above all else.</p>

        <p>In the end, *Parasite* isn’t just a movie about class—it’s a movie about the human condition. It’s about the lengths we’ll go to for survival, the compromises we make along the way, and the toll that ambition, desire, and inequality take on our relationships. Bong Joon-ho leaves us with a lot to think about, and the tragedy of *Parasite* is that, despite all its wit and humor, it reflects a reality that many of us live in—where success and failure aren’t just about hard work, but about the system stacked against us.</p>
